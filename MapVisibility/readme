I have finished the array checking for visibility
I have yet to finish a visual display for the array
The array output shows up on the web console

MapVisbility requires player location x,y, as well as the map size to run properly. I hard coded in the constants for now. 
The program right now marks records what the player has seen using a 2d array of cell objects.
